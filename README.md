# lambda-calculus
Lamda Calculus experiments. This just experiment that I wanted to try after seeing two great talks: 

Corey Haines GOTO 2015 Fun with the Lambda Calculus 
Gariel Lebec Fundamentals of Lambda Calculus &amp; Functional Programming in JavaScript

I used JS as learning Haskell would not make it easier :)
